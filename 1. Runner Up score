Print the runner-up score (second highest distinct score).

🧪 Sample Input
5
2 3 6 6 5

✅ Sample Output
5

🧠 Explanation

Given the list [2, 3, 6, 6, 5]:

The maximum score is 6

The second maximum (runner-up) score is 5

🧑‍💻 Python Solution


if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = map(int, input().split())
    
    unique_scores = list(set(arr))
    unique_scores.sort(reverse=True)
    
    Runner_Up = unique_scores[1]
    print(Runner_Up)
